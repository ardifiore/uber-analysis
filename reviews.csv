29,"Horrible, bunch of thieves. The fare you see when booking versus the fare you pay is completely different. The drivers make unrequested stops, drive slow, and extend the trip themselves, then the fare increases. I hate using Uber. They are very skelm. The drivers stop to top up on their fuel, and you are charged for the additional time he spent doing that. When I report it with evidence, I am told the trip is not eligible for a discount, and the fare is correct. Pissed off!!!!!",1,afternoon,Negative

99,"100 cancellation before someone accepts, only to then cancel on you when they're like 2min away. This company became a joke, extremely unreliable. Also some serious creeps using this, it's becoming unsafe especially for female riders. And if you report it..guess what, someone copy and pastes the same response to you and there's no consequences. it's hard to report anything, and there's no way at all to contact a human.

156,Two words: [cheap] grocery delivery! Glad I checked Uber on a whim one day while I was in a Lyft and found it's really expanded what it is. Definitely not what it was 10 years ago. (An expensive ride request app.) They roll out offers all the time. My grocery pick up from my local store costs about $6 which is awesome when I need my items asap and can't get immediate delivery from store. I plan to try more of what they offer.

636,I got an uber to the grocery store in the early evening. The store is 2 miles away. Traffic was light and i was by the road waiting for the driver when he pulled up. When i ordered the ride the app quoted the fee at $6 and some change. I use uber often on quick little trips such as this and that was the common price. I paid with an uber gift card and went about my shopping when i arrived i noticed they had charged me $15!! I had no choice but to order uber home. The trip home was $6. What gives,1,morning,Negative

So I cancel and low and behold there's a driver available. So I go to try again only to find that I can't because $10 has been taken out of my account due to pressing confirm. No money should be taken out until the driver has arrived or in the case of late fees. I shouldn't have to wait for it to be refunded and take more out of my savings,3,morning,Negative

So after this year's up I will be driving away from Uber :/,5,night,Positive

Worst app. There is no proper customer care services and the prices are also very high. Edit: Today I had to wait for 20 minutes. At last the driver cancelled the ride and I got late.

Pricing has become too expensive relative to normal taxis, but they have been forced out. The app is poor for customer protections. Eg a recent poor experience was difficult to report. In normal circumstances I wouldn't have paid for the fare, but with Uber you're stuck paying for a substandard journey. Generally, driver quality is terrible (confusing dangerously slow with safe!)",2,afternoon,Negative

Further, the customer redressal service is of no use. You can't approach Customer Care on an one-o-one basis (there is no call/direct msg facility available). On App's chat window, you'll keep apprising of your problem, and Uber People will keep responding with Standard and nonsense responses. Time to establish alternate",1,evening,Negative

Delivery drivers accept your order, then proceed to not deliver your order but to run personal errands or deliver for other services (Uber Eats GPS shows their location).

And at least in my area, drivers have so many wrong doings like driving away without you just to collect the cancelation fee since the app makes it so complicated to complain about the drivers that a lot of people just let it go. Many of them are maniacs on the road and they get offended if you ask them to drive safely or they straight up ignore you.",1,evening,Negative

Your cancelation numbers for instance are extremely important and the lower they are, the better for your account.

5092,Uber Shuttle booking is not happening and asking uber payment option to change. Worst app and worst company. Every time driver issues are there. Very unsafe. No complaint management.

My Ubers keep cancelling, meaning it can take over 30 minutes to be picked up.

Don't save your payment info on the app. Or better yet, don't use an app that is sneaky and predatory. The only way to contact customer service is through email.

6443,"Someone jumped in into the Uber I ordered and started riding. I cancelled since I wasn't in the car and got another Uber PICKED UP FROM THE EXACT SAME LOCATION. Uber charged me for both ""rides"" even though the other car still had the passenger. Apparently I can be in two cars at once according to Uber. Support was useless. Now I'm going to have to charge back BOTH rides so we're even.",1,night,Negative
6444,"It's becoming the worst app ever. While booking I got less amount with 50% valid coupon.

6446,I used the app when on vacation. I met every single driver at the designated spot at the designated time. I tipped every single driver. Some toxic driver gave me a bad rating for the sole purpose of being toxic and having nothing to do with my conduct.

The GPS gives the driver weird direction. Like I thought we would be going this way but goes the other way. Like turning up the street but go back to the same street we left? I give it four stars.

6455,"Uber was great, now it's almost impossible to find a ride. You have to wait for like 10 minutes just for the driver cancel your ride and you start all over again. I didn't find a way to tell Uber about this issue, there is no place in the app that we can communicate this frustrating experience. I'm searching for other apps to see if they are better.

Most, if not all, promotions are lying to you. Especially the Klarna 50% off when it isn't even 50%. And payments go thru pending when you ask for a ride, not when you receive one. So if Uber cancels your 20$ rides 5 times, guess you dont have 100$ until it falls back into your account at some point. Terrible experience overall",2,evening,Negative

7654,"The driver act like they are doing you a favor more than a paid service, as well as the time that you have to figure out where the car is when you arrive. The GPS always takes the longest route with the most construction. The pricing is competitive & and fare, but the wait might be the equalizer to how fare the price but not the service. I use both lfyt & Uber as a means of transit & lfyt may be a bit more the cars. Drivers are a bit more accommodating, but Uber was the first n will always be ok",2,evening,Negative

7658,The worst and terrible app I have used. They will charge at a fixed cost and the drivers won't accept pre-paid payments because they want more payments from the customer. I personally had a horrible experience of booking a cab and the driver dropped me off from the car forcibly asking for more money in the middle of the night and the driver had a very harsh behaviour with me asking more money to give in hand other than paid in app. They will not consider your situation rather will demand money.,1,evening,Negative

Despite being close, drivers refuse to come. Please do one thing when I enter the pin code of my area, the app should reject the booking itself so that I don't waste my time trying.

8255,"The worst e-hailing service ever! This company keeps deducting more money after I’ve completed a ride. They often charge me over R20 extra for most of my trips. Mind you, the trips follow the exact same route, the driver doesn’t wait, and there’s never any traffic. Every time I query these unjustified deductions, I get an automated email claiming there’s no mistake. It’s infuriating! I’m the one losing money here, and they refuse to take accountability.

The app lies about waiting times. I booked a ride expecting it to be a 1 minute wait as stated on the booking area, it turned out to be 15 minutes wait when a driver was found.

10868,Support is awful. Scams you with the up to 20 percent off with shared rides. In reality it'll take 15 minutes out your day to knock a single dollar off the charge. When your spending 30 bucks that's embarrassing. Uber is such a scam. To update Uber sucks even worse. They now got the ride share giving wildly inaccurate time-frames and you always end up spending 15 to 20 minutes extra in a ride when they NEVER knock the dollar off even anymore.

10947,Anyone who has a 3 star or above does not regularly use Uber. They intentionally increase prices for individual customers if they think you will keep going to the same location. They charge you more and rip off the drivers. Their fees are ridiculous and only seem reasonable if you use them to get to very different locations and use the app very rarely. It's a stupid business decision and very exploitative. Imagine having a restaurant and charging your most frequent customers more. 0 stars,1,evening,Negative

11862,"Doesn't work. No support. It used to work, and now it doesn't. Update, uninstall, reinstall, update payment method.

11868,Worst application I've been waiting for the driver to pickup since 30mins and trying to book but whenever someone picks up they says we take night charges and on uber se don't take night pickup as they give us less amount Then why the hell you guys keep your application open at night when your driver's don't accepts the pickup and night idiots really disappointed and uninstall this app It's a suggestion not to download this application it will waste your time,1,night,Negative

11889,Lately it is telling me the driver is on the way when I'm already in the car. And it does this multiple times per trip. Very annoying. And at first it was concerning too! I just updated it and it's still doing that.,2,night,Negative
11890,I am not sure what has taken place the past months but I hope to see a class action lawsuit for the misleading times that come up for how far the driver is away. Not accurate and the you select what you are assuming is how ever far away the driver is and then you go to finding driver and infant there are no drivers that times distance away. This had been happening consistently for.the pat few months then it says will connect to a driver by another time after. What was 4 min was 25 to wait lie,1,night,Negative
